**Hello everyone!**

I would like to introduce you to my first pet project - a movie search in a film library. Although this is not the final version, and many things still need debugging and enhancements, I wanted to share the current results with you. I want to note that there may be errors in logic, formatting, and layout in the project. However, it is important to remember that this is purely an educational project where I practice and experiment with new ideas. I strive to improve the project as my skills develop and receive feedback from users. I am always open to suggestions and ideas for improving functionality and fixing errors. Thank you for taking a look at my project! I hope you enjoy it and find useful information about movies in the film library.
